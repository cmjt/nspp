\title{Fitting a model to a Neyman-Scott point process}
\usage{
fit.ns(points = NULL, lims = NULL, R, child.disp.sv = 0.1 * R,
  child.disp.bounds = c(0, R), child.dist = list(mean = function(x) x, var =
  function(x) x, sv = 5, bounds = c(1e-08, 1e+08)), dispersion = "gaussian",
  siblings = NULL, trace = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{A matrix containing locations of observed points,
where each row corresponds to a point and each column corresponds
to a dimension.}

\item{lims}{A matrix with two columns, corresponding to the upper
and lower limits of each dimension, respectively.}

\item{R}{Truncation distance for the difference process.}

\item{child.disp.sv}{The start value for \code{child.disp} in optimisation.}

\item{child.disp.bounds}{The bounds of the \code{child.disp} parameter in
optimisation.}

\item{child.dist}{An argument describing the distribution
generating the number of children per parent. It must be a list
with four components: (1) A component named \code{mean} that
provides a function returning the expectation of the distribution,
with its only argument being the single parameter to be estimated,
(2) A component named \code{var} that provides a function returning
the variance of a distribution, with its only argument being the
single parameter to be estimated, (3) A component named \code{sv}
providing the start value for the parameter to be estimated, and
(4) A component named \code{bounds} providing a vector of length
two that gives the parameter bounds.}

\item{dispersion}{A character specifying if the dispersion of childern around parents are "gaussian" or "uniform",by deafault this is Gaussian.}

\item{siblings}{A named list, containing the following three
components: (1) A component named \code{matrix}, where the jth
element of the ith row is \code{TRUE} if the ith and jth observed
points are known siblings, \code{FALSE} if they are known
non-siblings, and \code{NA} if it is not known whether or not they
are siblings, (2) A component named pT, containing a scalar
providing the probability that the element (i, j) in the component
\code{matrix} is \code{TRUE}, conditional on the ith and jth points
being siblings, (3) A component named pF, containing a scalar
providing the probability that the element (i, j) in the component
\code{matrix} is \code{FALSE}, conditional on the ith and jth
points not being siblings.}

\item{trace}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, parameter values are printed
to the screen for each iteration of the optimisation procedure.}
}
\value{
An object with information that can be extracted via other
utility functions.
